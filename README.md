# Integration with Blazor, IdentityServer and Api

Working with [Blazor](https://www.puresourcecode.com/category/dotnet/blazor/) is starting to become very exciting. I want to share what I have learnt so far about Blazor, how to create Blazor compoents, how to implement security.

In the [PureSourceCode](https://www.puresourcecode.com) blog I wrote some posts about those topics.

- [Getting Started With C# And Blazor](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/getting-started-with-c-and-blazor/)
- [Setting Up A Blazor WebAssembly Application](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/blazor/setting-up-a-blazor-webassembly-application/)
- [Working With Blazorâ€™s Component Model](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/blazor/working-with-blazors-component-model/)
- [Secure Blazor WebAssembly With IdentityServer4](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/blazor/secure-blazor-webassembly-with-identityserver4/)
- [Blazor Using HttpClient With Authentication](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/blazor/blazor-using-httpclient-with-authentication/)

The source code in this repository is specificly for integrating security calls between Blazor and Api where the authentication and authorization is based on [IdentityServer4](https://www.puresourcecode.com/tag/identityserver4/).
